###Project was used to read in data from smart phones
###Tidy Dataset was created by Activity and Feature to includes Mean and Standard Deviation Measures
###Final Dataset was created with average of means by Activity and Feature

##The test data is read in first, then train, and last the descriptive information
##Data frames are then created and combined for each Feature that has a Mean reading
##This is repeated for the Training dataset


##Datasets are then combined into one
##The final dataset is created that calculates means by Activity and Feature

Activity - Activity Level as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Standing, Sitting, or Laying
Feature - Feature that is being measured
Mean - Mean measurement for each Activity and Feature
StdDev - Standard Deviation for each Activity and Feature
